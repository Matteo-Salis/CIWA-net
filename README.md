# CIWA-net


Repository for scripts and trained CIWA-net, a model for predicting GRACE data using ERA5 meteorological data in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Please, refer to the article: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/17/7632.

Here you can find the trained CIWA-net model with $\delta = 2$ and the history file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KqUDqdp6T3sJrXXN6wuFIDsylOVnEOO/view?usp=sharing, https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ou4Tn73FaCR2sBsrywGr_oQdJy--P_V/view?usp=sharing

ERA5 (era5_ds_reprojectd) and GRACE (grace_ds_interpolated) datasets are already pre-processed (see article for details) and ready-to-use. 

In the folder rasters you can find saved raster data for plotting images as in the code example.

Please cite the article https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/17/7632 if you use these pre-processed data or our pre-trained model.
